    <h3>A combination of different elements like cheese, pepperoni, flour, tomato, among others, makes what is known like a pizza.</h3>
    <p>First you have to prepare the mass, (the principal component of the pizza), in order to do this you have to, in a bowl
        put some flour, butter and yeast, then, you have to mix all together until you have a thick mass. <br>
        After that, the next step is to cover all the mass (except the edges) with the tomato sauce, then
        spread cheese all over the mass and the tomate sauce, finally you can put whatever element you like the most,
        like pepperoni or sausage or whatever, after that the final step is to bake the pizza for around 1 hour and voila.</p>
